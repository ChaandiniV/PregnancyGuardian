WHO Pregnancy Guidelines and Medical Knowledge Base

SYMPTOM CATEGORIZATION BY SEVERITY AND CONTEXT

Normal (Low Risk) Symptoms:
- Mild Nausea: Common in the 1st trimester due to hCG hormone. Normal physiological response.
- Light Spotting: Possible during implantation (first 4-6 weeks). Monitor but not immediately concerning.
- Mild Back Pain: Due to ligament stretching and postural changes. Normal pregnancy adaptation.
- Constipation & Gas: Related to progesterone slowing digestion. Common throughout pregnancy.
- Breast Tenderness: Normal hormonal response in early pregnancy.
- Frequent Urination: Normal due to increased blood volume and uterine pressure.
- Fatigue: Common in first and third trimesters due to hormonal changes.

Medium Risk Indicators:
- Persistent Vomiting > 3x/day: Could suggest hyperemesis gravidarum requiring medical evaluation.
- Elevated Blood Pressure (≥140/90): Must monitor for preeclampsia development.
- Gestational Diabetes Symptoms: Excessive thirst, fatigue, frequent urination beyond normal.
- Mild Vaginal Bleeding in 2nd/3rd Trimester: Needs immediate OB evaluation for placental issues.
- Regular Contractions before 37 weeks: Potential preterm labor requiring assessment.
- Decreased Fetal Movement: After 28 weeks, concerning for fetal wellbeing.

High Risk / Emergency Symptoms:
- Heavy Vaginal Bleeding + Cramping: Miscarriage or placental abruption - immediate care needed.
- Severe Abdominal Pain (localized): Possible ectopic pregnancy (if early) or other complications.
- Blurry Vision + Headache + Swelling: Classic triad of preeclampsia requiring immediate intervention.
- Fever > 38.5°C with chills: Suspected intrauterine infection or other serious condition.
- Reduced or No Fetal Movement: Fetal distress, hypoxia, or demise - emergency evaluation.
- Severe Headaches with visual disturbances: Preeclampsia or other neurological complications.
- Chest Pain or Difficulty Breathing: Pulmonary embolism or cardiac complications.

RISK FACTORS & TRIGGERS BY CONDITION

Preeclampsia Risk Factors:
- First pregnancy (nulliparity)
- Maternal age <18 or >35 years
- Obesity (BMI > 30)
- Chronic hypertension
- Diabetes or kidney disease
- Multiple gestation
- Family history of preeclampsia

Preeclampsia Warning Signs:
- Protein in urine (proteinuria)
- Severe headaches that don't respond to medication
- Epigastric pain (upper abdominal pain)
- Visual disturbances (blurred vision, seeing spots)
- Sudden weight gain and swelling
- Decreased urine output

Gestational Diabetes Risk Factors:
- BMI > 25 before pregnancy
- Family history of type 2 diabetes
- Previous macrosomia (baby >4kg)
- Previous gestational diabetes
- Age > 25 years
- Certain ethnic backgrounds (Hispanic, African American, Native American, Asian)

Gestational Diabetes Symptoms:
- Often subtle or asymptomatic
- Excessive fatigue beyond normal pregnancy
- Increased thirst (polydipsia)
- Frequent urination beyond normal
- Blurred vision
- Detected via glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks

Preterm Labor Warning Signs (before 37 weeks):
- Regular contractions (every 10 minutes or less)
- Lower back pressure or pain
- Pelvic pressure or cramping
- Watery discharge or rupture of membranes
- Change in vaginal discharge
- Dull, persistent lower backache

Placenta Previa:
- Placenta covers cervix partially or completely
- Classic symptom: Painless bright red vaginal bleeding
- Usually detected on ultrasound
- Requires C-section if persists near term
- Bleeding episodes may increase in frequency and severity

Ectopic Pregnancy (6-8 weeks):
- Implantation outside uterus (commonly fallopian tube)
- Sharp, stabbing one-sided abdominal or pelvic pain
- Vaginal bleeding (lighter or heavier than normal period)
- Dizziness, lightheadedness, or fainting
- Shoulder tip pain (if internal bleeding)
- Nausea and vomiting

RED FLAG SYMPTOM COMBINATIONS

Critical Combinations Requiring Immediate Care:
1. Severe headache + vision changes + swelling = Severe Preeclampsia
2. Heavy bleeding + sharp abdominal pain + low blood pressure = Placental abruption/Ectopic
3. Fever + vaginal discharge + abdominal tenderness = Chorioamnionitis (Infection)
4. No fetal movement after 28 weeks + decreased baseline variability = Fetal compromise
5. Contractions < 37 weeks + cervical changes = Preterm labor
6. Chest pain + shortness of breath + leg swelling = Pulmonary embolism

SYMPTOM TIMELINE BY TRIMESTER

First Trimester (Weeks 1-12):
- Primary risks: Miscarriage, Ectopic Pregnancy, Hyperemesis Gravidarum
- Normal symptoms: Nausea, breast tenderness, fatigue, frequent urination
- Red flags: Severe one-sided pain, heavy bleeding, shoulder pain, severe vomiting

Second Trimester (Weeks 13-27):
- Primary risks: Gestational Diabetes, Cervical Insufficiency, Neural tube defects
- Normal symptoms: Increased energy, baby movement begins (~20 weeks), appetite increase
- Red flags: Lack of fetal movement after 20 weeks, regular contractions, fluid leaking

Third Trimester (Weeks 28-40+):
- Primary risks: Preeclampsia, Preterm Labor, Placental complications, Stillbirth
- Normal symptoms: Braxton-Hicks contractions, heartburn, swelling in feet
- Red flags: Severe swelling in face/hands, no fetal movement, regular contractions before 37 weeks

RISK ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES

Low Risk Assessment Criteria:
- Normal physiological pregnancy symptoms
- No concerning symptom combinations
- Symptoms consistent with gestational age
- No significant risk factors present
Action: Routine prenatal care, self-monitoring, lifestyle modifications

Medium Risk Assessment Criteria:
- Isolated concerning symptoms requiring evaluation
- Risk factors present without acute symptoms
- Symptoms that could indicate developing complications
Action: Contact healthcare provider within 24-48 hours, increased monitoring

High Risk Assessment Criteria:
- Emergency symptom combinations present
- Severe isolated symptoms (heavy bleeding, severe pain)
- Signs of serious pregnancy complications
Action: Immediate medical attention, emergency department evaluation

PROACTIVE QUESTIONING FRAMEWORK

Essential Screening Questions:
1. "Are you currently experiencing any unusual bleeding or discharge?"
2. "How would you describe your baby's movements today compared to yesterday?" (after 20 weeks)
3. "Have you had any headaches that won't go away or affect your vision?"
4. "Do you feel any pressure, pain, or cramping in your pelvis or lower back?"
5. "Have you had a fever or noticed any foul-smelling discharge?"

Follow-up Questions Based on Responses:
- If bleeding: "How heavy is the bleeding? Are you passing clots? Any cramping?"
- If headache: "How severe? Any vision changes? Swelling in hands or face?"
- If pain: "Where exactly? How severe on 1-10 scale? Constant or intermittent?"
- If movement concerns: "When did you last feel baby move? Normal pattern for you?"

EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS

For Low Risk:
- Continue routine prenatal appointments
- Maintain healthy diet with prenatal vitamins
- Stay hydrated and get adequate rest
- Monitor symptoms and report changes
- Follow exercise guidelines for pregnancy

For Medium Risk:
- Schedule appointment with healthcare provider within 24-48 hours
- Keep symptom diary with timing and severity
- Avoid strenuous activities until evaluated
- Stay hydrated and rest
- Have emergency contact information readily available

For High Risk:
- Seek immediate medical attention
- Go to nearest emergency department or labor & delivery
- Do not drive yourself if experiencing severe symptoms
- Bring pregnancy records and medication list
- Call emergency services if symptoms are severe or worsening rapidly
