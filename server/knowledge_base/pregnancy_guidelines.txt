PREGNANCY RISK ASSESSMENT KNOWLEDGE BASE

1. SYMPTOM CATEGORIZATION BY SEVERITY AND CONTEXT

NORMAL (LOW RISK) SYMPTOMS:
- Mild nausea: Common in 1st trimester due to hCG hormone
- Light spotting: Possible during implantation (first 4-6 weeks)
- Mild back pain: Due to ligament stretching
- Constipation & gas: Related to progesterone slowing digestion
- Fatigue: Normal due to hormonal changes
- Breast tenderness: Normal hormonal response

MEDIUM RISK INDICATORS:
- Persistent vomiting >3x/day: Could suggest hyperemesis gravidarum
- Elevated blood pressure (≥140/90): Must monitor for preeclampsia
- Gestational diabetes symptoms: Excessive thirst, fatigue, frequent urination
- Mild vaginal bleeding in 2nd/3rd trimester: Needs immediate OB evaluation
- Decreased fetal movement: Requires monitoring
- Persistent headaches: Could indicate hypertension

HIGH RISK / EMERGENCY:
- Heavy vaginal bleeding + cramping: Miscarriage or placental abruption
- Severe abdominal pain (localized): Possible ectopic pregnancy (if early)
- Blurry vision + headache + swelling: Classic triad of preeclampsia
- Fever >38.5°C with chills: Suspected intrauterine infection
- Reduced or no fetal movement: Fetal distress, hypoxia, or demise
- Severe continuous headache with vision changes
- Sudden severe abdominal pain
- Rupture of membranes before 37 weeks

2. RISK FACTORS & TRIGGERS BY CONDITION

PREECLAMPSIA:
Risk increases with:
- First pregnancy
- Age <18 or >35
- Obesity (BMI > 30)
- Chronic hypertension
- Diabetes or kidney disease
- Multiple pregnancy

Watch for:
- Protein in urine
- Severe headaches
- Epigastric pain
- Visual disturbances
- Sudden weight gain

GESTATIONAL DIABETES:
Risk increases with:
- BMI > 25
- Family history of diabetes
- Previous macrosomia (>4kg baby)
- Previous gestational diabetes

Symptoms often subtle:
- Fatigue, thirst, blurred vision
- Detected via glucose tolerance test (OGTT)

PRETERM LABOR:
Warning signs before 37 weeks:
- Regular contractions
- Lower back pressure
- Pelvic pressure
- Watery discharge or rupture of membranes
- Change in vaginal discharge

PLACENTA PREVIA:
- Placenta covers cervix partially/completely
- Classic symptom: Painless bright red vaginal bleeding
- Requires C-section if persists near term

ECTOPIC PREGNANCY:
- Implantation outside uterus (commonly fallopian tube)
- Symptoms in 6-8 weeks:
- Sharp one-sided pain
- Dizziness or fainting
- Shoulder tip pain (if internal bleeding)

3. RED FLAG SYMPTOM COMBINATIONS

Severe headache + vision changes + swelling = Preeclampsia (HIGH RISK)
Bleeding + sharp abdominal pain + low BP = Ectopic Pregnancy (HIGH RISK)
Fever + vaginal discharge + abdominal tenderness = Chorioamnionitis (HIGH RISK)
No fetal movement after 28 weeks = Fetal demise or distress (HIGH RISK)
Contractions < 37 weeks + cervical changes = Preterm labor (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK)

4. SYMPTOM TIMELINE REFERENCE BY TRIMESTER

FIRST TRIMESTER (Weeks 1-12):
Risk: Miscarriage, Ectopic Pregnancy
Normal symptoms: Nausea, spotting, fatigue
Red flags: Severe pain, heavy bleeding, shoulder pain

SECOND TRIMESTER (Weeks 13-27):
Risk: Gestational Diabetes, Cervical Insufficiency
Normal symptoms: Baby movement begins (~20 weeks), increased appetite
Red flags: Lack of movement, contractions, leaking fluid

THIRD TRIMESTER (Weeks 28-40+):
Risk: Preeclampsia, Preterm Labor, Stillbirth
Normal symptoms: Heartburn, Braxton-Hicks, swelling
Red flags: Severe swelling, no fetal movement, bleeding

5. EVIDENCE-BASED RECOMMENDATIONS

LOW RISK:
- Self-monitor symptoms
- Routine prenatal follow-up
- Maintain healthy diet and exercise
- Take prenatal vitamins

MEDIUM RISK:
- Contact doctor within 24 hours
- Monitor symptoms closely
- May need additional testing
- Follow up within 1-2 days

HIGH RISK:
- Immediate visit to ER or OB emergency care
- Call 911 if severe symptoms
- Do not delay medical attention
- May require immediate intervention

6. WHO GUIDELINES FOR PREGNANCY CARE

- Regular prenatal visits starting at 8-12 weeks
- Blood pressure monitoring at each visit
- Urine testing for protein and glucose
- Fetal growth monitoring
- Vaccination schedules (influenza, Tdap)
- Nutritional counseling
- Mental health screening

7. EMERGENCY CONTACT CRITERIA

CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY FOR:
- Heavy bleeding with clots
- Severe abdominal pain
- Loss of consciousness
- Difficulty breathing
- Chest pain
- Seizures
- Signs of stroke

CONTACT OB/GYN URGENTLY FOR:
- Persistent vomiting
- High fever
- Severe headache
- Vision changes
- Decreased fetal movement
- Leaking fluid
- Regular contractions before 37 weeks

8. RISK ASSESSMENT SCORING

LOW RISK (Score 0-3):
- Normal pregnancy symptoms
- No concerning combinations
- Appropriate for gestational age

MEDIUM RISK (Score 4-7):
- Some concerning symptoms
- May indicate developing condition
- Requires medical evaluation

HIGH RISK (Score 8+):
- Multiple red flag symptoms
- Emergency condition likely
- Immediate medical attention required
