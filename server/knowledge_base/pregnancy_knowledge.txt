PREGNANCY RISK MANAGEMENT KNOWLEDGE BASE

SYMPTOM CATEGORIZATION BY SEVERITY AND CONTEXT

NORMAL (LOW RISK) SYMPTOMS:
- Mild Nausea: Common in the 1st trimester due to hCG hormone changes
- Light Spotting: Possible during implantation (first 4-6 weeks of pregnancy)
- Mild Back Pain: Due to ligament stretching as uterus expands
- Constipation & Gas: Related to progesterone hormone slowing digestion
- Mild Fatigue: Normal during first and third trimesters
- Breast Tenderness: Common early pregnancy symptom
- Frequent Urination: Normal due to increased blood volume and uterine pressure

MEDIUM RISK INDICATORS:
- Persistent Vomiting >3x/day: Could suggest hyperemesis gravidarum requiring medical attention
- Elevated Blood Pressure (≥140/90): Must monitor for preeclampsia development
- Gestational Diabetes Symptoms: Excessive thirst, fatigue, frequent urination beyond normal
- Mild Vaginal Bleeding in 2nd/3rd Trimester: Needs immediate OB evaluation
- Severe Heartburn: May indicate GERD requiring treatment
- Swollen Hands/Feet: Monitor for preeclampsia if sudden or severe
- Decreased Fetal Movement: After 28 weeks, reduced movement patterns need evaluation

HIGH RISK / EMERGENCY SYMPTOMS:
- Heavy Vaginal Bleeding + Cramping: Indicates possible miscarriage or placental abruption
- Severe Abdominal Pain (localized): Possible ectopic pregnancy if early, other complications if later
- Blurry Vision + Headache + Swelling: Classic triad of preeclampsia requiring immediate care
- Fever >38.5°C with chills: Suspected intrauterine infection
- Reduced or No Fetal Movement: Fetal distress, hypoxia, or demise requiring emergency assessment
- Severe Chest Pain: Possible pulmonary embolism or cardiac issues
- Difficulty Breathing: May indicate pulmonary edema or embolism
- Persistent Severe Headaches: Possible preeclampsia or hypertensive crisis

RISK FACTORS & TRIGGERS BY CONDITION

PREECLAMPSIA:
Risk increases with:
- First pregnancy (nulliparity)
- Maternal age <18 or >35 years
- Obesity (BMI >30)
- Chronic hypertension
- Pre-existing diabetes or kidney disease
- Multiple pregnancies (twins/triplets)
- Family history of preeclampsia

Watch for symptoms:
- Protein in urine (proteinuria)
- Severe headaches that don't respond to treatment
- Epigastric pain (upper abdominal pain)
- Visual disturbances (blurred vision, seeing spots)
- Sudden weight gain (>2 lbs per week)

GESTATIONAL DIABETES:
Risk increases with:
- BMI >25 before pregnancy
- Family history of type 2 diabetes
- Previous history of gestational diabetes
- Previous macrosomia (baby >4kg)
- Age >25 years
- Certain ethnicities (Hispanic, African American, Native American, Asian)

Symptoms often subtle:
- Excessive fatigue beyond normal pregnancy tiredness
- Increased thirst despite adequate hydration
- Blurred vision
- Detected via glucose tolerance test (OGTT) at 24-28 weeks

PRETERM LABOR:
Warning signs before 37 weeks:
- Regular contractions (every 10 minutes or more frequent)
- Lower back pressure or pain
- Pelvic pressure sensation
- Watery discharge or rupture of membranes
- Change in vaginal discharge
- Menstrual-like cramping

PLACENTA PREVIA:
- Placenta covers cervix partially or completely
- Classic symptom: Painless bright red vaginal bleeding
- Usually diagnosed via ultrasound
- Requires cesarean section if persists near term
- Complete bed rest often prescribed

ECTOPIC PREGNANCY:
- Implantation outside uterus (commonly fallopian tube)
- Occurs in first 6-8 weeks of pregnancy
- Symptoms include:
  - Sharp one-sided abdominal or pelvic pain
  - Vaginal bleeding (may be light)
  - Dizziness or fainting
  - Shoulder tip pain (indicates internal bleeding)
  - Nausea and vomiting

RED FLAG SYMPTOM COMBINATIONS

CRITICAL COMBINATIONS REQUIRING IMMEDIATE CARE:
1. Severe headache + vision changes + swelling = Preeclampsia (HIGH RISK)
2. Bleeding + sharp abdominal pain + low blood pressure = Ectopic Pregnancy (HIGH RISK)
3. Fever + vaginal discharge + abdominal tenderness = Chorioamnionitis/Infection (HIGH RISK)
4. No fetal movement after 28 weeks = Fetal demise or distress (HIGH RISK)
5. Contractions <37 weeks + cervical changes = Preterm labor (MEDIUM-HIGH RISK)

SYMPTOM TIMELINE REFERENCE BY TRIMESTER

FIRST TRIMESTER (Weeks 1-12):
Primary Risks: Miscarriage, Ectopic Pregnancy
Normal Symptoms: Nausea, mild spotting, breast tenderness, fatigue
Red Flags: Severe cramping with bleeding, one-sided sharp pain, shoulder pain

SECOND TRIMESTER (Weeks 13-27):
Primary Risks: Gestational Diabetes, Cervical Insufficiency, Preterm Labor
Normal Symptoms: Baby movement begins (~20 weeks), increased appetite, round ligament pain
Red Flags: Lack of fetal movement after 20 weeks, regular contractions, leaking fluid

THIRD TRIMESTER (Weeks 28-40+):
Primary Risks: Preeclampsia, Preterm Labor, Placental Complications, Stillbirth
Normal Symptoms: Heartburn, Braxton-Hicks contractions, mild swelling, sleep issues
Red Flags: Severe swelling, no fetal movement, heavy bleeding, severe headaches

PROACTIVE ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS

SYMPTOM ASSESSMENT QUESTIONS:
- "Are you currently experiencing any unusual bleeding or discharge?"
- "How would you describe your baby's movements today compared to yesterday?"
- "Have you had any headaches that won't go away or that affect your vision?"
- "Do you feel any pressure or pain in your pelvis or lower back?"
- "Have you had a fever or noticed any foul-smelling discharge?"
- "Are you experiencing any nausea or vomiting, and how severe is it?"
- "Have you noticed any swelling in your hands, face, or feet?"
- "Are you having any difficulty breathing or chest pain?"

RISK ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK

LOW RISK INDICATORS:
- Normal fatigue and mild nausea
- Light spotting in early pregnancy
- Mild back pain and round ligament pain
- Normal fetal movement patterns
- Stable blood pressure and weight gain

SUGGESTED ACTION: Self-monitor symptoms, maintain routine prenatal follow-up appointments, continue prenatal vitamins and healthy lifestyle.

MEDIUM RISK INDICATORS:
- Persistent vomiting affecting daily activities
- Mild to moderate hypertension
- Gestational diabetes diagnosis
- Reduced but present fetal movement
- Mild bleeding in second/third trimester

SUGGESTED ACTION: Contact healthcare provider within 24 hours, increase monitoring frequency, may need additional testing or treatment modifications.

HIGH RISK INDICATORS:
- Heavy bleeding with cramping
- Severe abdominal or pelvic pain
- High blood pressure with symptoms
- Signs of infection (fever, abnormal discharge)
- No fetal movement for extended period
- Severe headaches with vision changes

SUGGESTED ACTION: Immediate visit to emergency room or OB emergency care, do not delay seeking medical attention, call emergency services if severe.

EMERGENCY PROTOCOL

CALL 911 IMMEDIATELY IF:
- Heavy vaginal bleeding that soaks more than one pad per hour
- Severe abdominal pain that prevents normal activities
- Signs of shock (dizziness, fainting, rapid heartbeat)
- Difficulty breathing or chest pain
- Severe headache with vision changes and swelling
- Seizures or loss of consciousness

CONTACT OB PROVIDER IMMEDIATELY IF:
- Any bleeding in second or third trimester
- Regular contractions before 37 weeks
- Sudden decrease in fetal movement
- Persistent severe headaches
- Signs of preeclampsia (headache, vision changes, upper abdominal pain)
- Fever over 38.5°C (101.3°F)
- Persistent vomiting preventing food/fluid intake

RISK MITIGATION STRATEGIES

LIFESTYLE MODIFICATIONS:
- Maintain regular prenatal appointments
- Take prenatal vitamins with folic acid
- Avoid alcohol, smoking, and recreational drugs
- Limit caffeine intake
- Stay hydrated and eat balanced meals
- Get adequate rest and manage stress
- Exercise as recommended by healthcare provider
- Monitor weight gain according to BMI guidelines

WARNING SIGNS EDUCATION:
- Educate on normal vs. concerning symptoms
- Provide clear guidelines on when to call provider
- Ensure understanding of emergency symptoms
- Document all symptoms and their patterns
- Keep emergency contact information readily available

This knowledge base should be used to provide evidence-based risk assessments and recommendations for pregnant women based on their reported symptoms and medical history.
