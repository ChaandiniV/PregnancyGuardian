# Netlify Deployment Fix Guide

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Missing Symptom Checkboxes
**Problem**: Assessment page shows empty space instead of symptom selection checkboxes
**Root Cause**: API symptoms endpoint not accessible on Netlify
**Solution**: Added fallback symptom list in frontend component

### 2. Chat API Errors  
**Problem**: Chat shows "error processing assessment" instead of results
**Root Cause**: Assessment API endpoint failing on Netlify functions
**Solution**: Enhanced error handling with offline fallback assessment

## Fixed Components

### Frontend Fixes (client/src/pages/assessment.tsx)
- Added fallback symptom list with 25 common pregnancy symptoms
- Enhanced error handling with retry logic
- Automatic fallback when API unavailable

### Backend Fixes (netlify/functions/api.js)
- Added duplicate API routes (/api/symptoms and /symptoms)
- Enhanced error logging for debugging
- Improved validation and response handling
- Added alternative assessment endpoint

### Chat Fixes (client/src/components/chat-modal.tsx)
- Added comprehensive fallback assessment function
- Error handling that provides results even when API fails
- Rule-based risk assessment for offline functionality
