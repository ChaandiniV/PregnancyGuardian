Redefining Pregnancy Care  for a Healthier Future 
Intern Task: Build & Deploy a Proactive RAG Agent for Pregnant Women Risk Management 
Objective: 
Build a proactive, conversational chatbot that uses LlamaIndex for retrieval-augmented generation 
(RAG) to assess risk factors in pregnant women. The bot should proactively ask about symptoms, 
retrieve relevant information from medical sources, and give risk insights or suggestions. The final 
chatbot should be deployed on a free web hosting service and publicly accessible. 
Task Requirements 
1. Use Case 
• The agent will: 
o Start the conversation proactively by asking key symptom questions. 
o Collect user input (e.g., nausea, bleeding, dizziness). 
o Use RAG (via LlamaIndex + LLM) to pull relevant insights from documents (e.g., WHO 
guidelines, research). 
o Provide a risk assessment response (e.g., “Mild risk – monitor at home”, “High risk – 
visit ER”). 
2. Technical Stack 
• Language Model: Any LLM (e.g., Qwen, Gemini, OpenAI,..). 
• RAG Backend: LlamaIndex. 
• Frontend: Streamlit, Gradio, or simple HTML/JS interface. 
• Deployment: Use any free platform like: 
o Render 
o Hugging Face Spaces 
o Vercel 
o Streamlit Cloud

3. Features 
• Proactive Questioning: Ask 3–5 symptom-related questions before responding. 
• RAG-Powered Answers: Fetch info from uploaded/indexed docs. 
• Risk Level Output: Low / Medium / High + Suggested Action. 
• Conversational: Simple, friendly, and empathetic tone. 
5. Deliverables 
• Working public URL of the deployed chatbot. 
• GitHub repo with: 
o All code (backend, frontend, LlamaIndex setup). 
o Instructions to run locally. 
o Optional: Requirements.txt. 
• README.md with: 
o Problem description 
o System architecture 
o Example queries and outputs 
o Deployment steps 
Deadline: 
Submit the working demo and GitHub repo within 2 weeks.

RAG Knowledge Base
 Level 2: Intermediate Knowledge Base for Pregnancy Risk Management 
1. Symptom Categorization by Severity and Context 
Normal (Low Risk) 
• Mild Nausea: Common in the 1st trimester due to hCG hormone. 
• Light Spotting: Possible during implantation (first 4–6 weeks). 
• Mild Back Pain: Due to ligament stretching. 
• Constipation & Gas: Related to progesterone slowing digestion. 
Medium Risk Indicators 
• Persistent Vomiting > 3x/day: Could suggest hyperemesis gravidarum. 
• Elevated Blood Pressure (≥140/90): Must monitor for preeclampsia. 
• Gestational Diabetes Symptoms: Excessive thirst, fatigue, frequent urination. 
• Mild Vaginal Bleeding in 2nd/3rd Trimester: Needs immediate OB evaluation. 
High Risk / Emergency 
• Heavy Vaginal Bleeding + Cramping: Miscarriage or placental abruption. 
• Severe Abdominal Pain (localized): Possible ectopic pregnancy (if early). 
• Blurry Vision + Headache + Swelling: Classic triad of preeclampsia. 
• Fever > 38.5°C with chills: Suspected intrauterine infection. 
• Reduced or No Fetal Movement: Fetal distress, hypoxia, or demise.

2. Risk Factors & Triggers by Condition 
Preeclampsia 
• Risk increases with: 
o First pregnancy 
o Age <18 or >35 
o Obesity (BMI > 30) 
o Chronic hypertension 
o Diabetes or kidney disease 
• Watch for: 
o Protein in urine 
o Severe headaches 
o Epigastric pain 
o Visual disturbances 
Gestational Diabetes 
• Risk increases with: 
o BMI > 25 
o Family history of diabetes 
o Previous macrosomia (>4kg baby) 
• Symptoms often subtle: 
o Fatigue, thirst, blurred vision 
o Detected via glucose tolerance test (OGTT) 
Preterm Labor 
• Warning signs before 37 weeks: 
o Regular contractions 
o Lower back pressure

Redefining Pregnancy Care  for a Healthier Future 
o Pelvic pressure 
o Watery discharge or rupture of membranes 
Placenta Previa 
• Placenta covers cervix partially/completely. 
• Classic symptom: Painless bright red vaginal bleeding 
• Requires C-section if persists near term. 
Ectopic Pregnancy 
• Implantation outside uterus (commonly fallopian tube) 
• Symptoms in 6–8 weeks: 
o Sharp one-sided pain 
o Dizziness or fainting 
o Shoulder tip pain (if internal bleeding)
