# Quick Deployment Instructions

I've fixed the Python version issues and created a simplified deployment setup. Your pregnancy health app is now ready to deploy on multiple platforms.

## Fixed Issues:
✓ Removed problematic Python dependencies
✓ Created Node.js-only deployment configuration
✓ Simplified Netlify function setup
✓ Added proper build configurations

## Recommended Deployment: Netlify

1. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Create a new GitHub repository
   - Upload all your files to the repository

2. **Deploy on Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com](https://netlify.com) and sign up (free)
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Connect your GitHub account
   - Select your repository
   - Netlify will auto-detect the build settings from `netlify.toml`
   - Click "Deploy site"

3. **Your app will be live** at `https://[random-name].netlify.app`

## Alternative Options:

### Vercel (Similar to Netlify)
- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Import from GitHub
- Auto-deployment from `vercel.json`

### Railway (Full-stack friendly)
- Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Deploy from GitHub
- Uses `railway.json` configuration

## What's Included:
- Complete pregnancy health assessment app
- Risk evaluation system
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Emergency contact features
- Medical disclaimers

Your app will work immediately after deployment with basic risk assessment functionality.
